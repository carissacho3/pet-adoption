        Welcome to Pet Adoption - Where Every Pet Finds a Home
      </h5>
      <p className={styles.par}>
        At Pet Adoption, our mission is simple: to connect loving families with
        homeless pets in need of a second chance. We believe every animal
        deserves a safe, happy, and nurturing environment. Since our founding in
        2019, we've helped thousands of cats, dogs, and other animals find
        forever homes.
      </p>

      <h5 className={styles.header}>Who We Are</h5>
      <p className={styles.par}>
        We are a passionate team of animal lovers, volunteers, and advocates
        dedicated to animal welfare. From rescuing strays and abandoned pets to
        organizing foster care and adoption events, our work is driven by
        compassion and commitment.

      <h5 className={styles.header}>Why It Matters</h5>
      <p className={styles.par}>
        Every year, millions of animals end up in shelters. Many never make it
        out. By adopting, you're not only saving a lifeâ€”you're making room for
        us to rescue another in need.
      </p>

        loving home they deserve.
